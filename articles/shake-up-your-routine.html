      <h1>Shake Up Your Routine</h1>
      <p>Break free from smoking habits for good.</p>

      <h2>A Fresh Start</h2>
      <p>Quitting smoking isn't just about resisting nicotine—it's about <strong>rewiring your daily habits</strong>. Smoking is often tied to routines: that morning cigarette with coffee, the break-time smoke at work, or the habit of lighting up after meals. These small moments can be <strong>triggers</strong> that pull you back in, but the key to long-term success is to <strong>shake things up and create new patterns</strong> that work for you instead of against you.</p>

      <h2>1. Change Your Environment</h2>
      <p>Your brain associates certain places and activities with smoking. To break those connections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rearrange your space</strong> – If you always smoked on the porch, try sitting in a different chair or moving indoor plants outside.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep clean your car and home</strong> – Get rid of smoke smells and replace them with fresh scents like citrus or peppermint.</li>
        <li><strong>Take a different route</strong> – If you stop at a gas station that tempts you to buy cigarettes, find a new one.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Replace Old Habits with Healthy Ones</h2>
      <p>The urge to smoke is often just muscle memory. When you feel it creeping up:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep your hands busy</strong> – Carry a stress ball, fidget toy, or even a pen to mimic the hand-to-mouth motion.</li>
        <li><strong>Chew on something</strong> – Sugar-free gum, sunflower seeds, or crunchy snacks like carrots can help.</li>
        <li><strong>Breathe deeply</strong> – Instead of inhaling smoke, take slow, deep breaths to calm your mind and reduce cravings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Flip the Script on Your Daily Routine</h2>
      <p>Small changes in your routine can help you <strong>break free from the cycle</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>If you always smoked with coffee...</strong> try switching to tea or drinking your coffee in a different room.</li>
        <li><strong>If you smoked after meals...</strong> go for a quick walk, do a few stretches, or brush your teeth right away.</li>
        <li><strong>If stress triggers you...</strong> journal, listen to music, or try a short meditation instead.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Get Active, Get Moving</h2>
      <p>Physical activity releases <strong>feel-good endorphins</strong>, reducing stress and nicotine cravings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try <strong>a short walk</strong> after meals instead of lighting up.</li>
        <li>Experiment with <strong>a new workout</strong>—yoga, dancing, biking—anything that makes you feel alive.</li>
        <li>Keep a <strong>stretching routine</strong> at your desk to replace smoke breaks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>You're Creating a New You</h2>
      <p>Quitting smoking isn't about <strong>losing</strong> something—it's about <strong>gaining freedom</strong>. Every time you shake up your routine, you're rewiring your brain and taking another step toward a healthier, stronger version of yourself.</p>

      <p>Change isn't always easy, but it <strong>starts with small shifts</strong>—and those small shifts lead to a <strong>smoke-free, empowered future</strong>. Keep going. You've got this.</p>
