      <h2>Immediate Impact</h2>
      <p>Quitting cold turkey allows your body to start recovering immediately. Within 24 hours, your carbon monoxide levels normalize, and your heart begins to pump blood more efficiently. By cutting off nicotine completely, you give your body the chance to reset and heal without relying on substitutes.</p>

      <h2>Mental Clarity</h2>
      <p>The cold turkey method provides a clear psychological advantage. The act of quitting abruptly signals a strong commitment to yourself and your health. There's no middle ground or lingering dependency—just a decisive break from the habit.</p>

      <h2>Avoiding Dependency on Substitutes</h2>
      <p>Nicotine replacement products like patches or gum can be helpful, but they often extend the process of quitting by maintaining a low-level dependency. Cold turkey eliminates the need for these products, allowing you to fully free yourself from nicotine in one step.</p>

      <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Have a Plan:</strong> Know your triggers and prepare strategies to handle them.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Busy:</strong> Distract yourself with activities like exercise, hobbies, or spending time with friends.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek Support:</strong> Lean on loved ones or join a community of others who have quit or are in the process of quitting.</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate Milestones:</strong> Each day nicotine-free is a victory. Recognize your progress and reward yourself along the way.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Inspiring Statistics</h2>
      <p>Research shows that going cold turkey can be highly effective. In a study published in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>, smokers who quit abruptly were 25% more likely to succeed long-term than those who gradually reduced their nicotine intake.</p>

      <p>Quitting cold turkey isn't for everyone, but if you're ready to make a clean break, it can be one of the most rewarding decisions of your life. The road might be tough, but the destination—a healthier, nicotine-free you—is worth it. You're stronger than you think, and you've got this!</p>
