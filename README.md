## 🙏 Why I Built This

Quitting nicotine is one of the hardest things people go through — I’ve been there. I wanted to build a space that offers encouragement, real-life motivation, and a bit of technology to help people track and celebrate their success. Building this has helped me stay quit. This is both a passion project and a long-term foundation for building more full-featured, user-driven tools.
